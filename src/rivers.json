It is a spring-fed river that flows over a bed of limestone from about 20 miles west of Hunt, in Kerr County, down to a rocky bed toward Canyon Lake in Comal County over a distance of about 82 miles, then another 280-300 miles to San Antonio Bay on the Gulf of Mexico.",

The Medina is a narrow river averaging about 30-40 feet wide and is lined with Bald Cypress trees, though not nearly as many as before the flood of 2002.",
